The head office is based in Apia, Samoa with about 100 staff. There is also a SPREP office in Fiji with four staff as well as SPREP Officers stationed in the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. SPREP has an annual budget of USD $29 million in 2018. The establishment of SPREP sends a clear signal to the global community of the deep commitment of Pacific island Governments and Administrations for better management of the environment within the context of sustainable development. The strategic direction for SPREP is clearly set out in the 2017-2026 SPREP Strategic Plan. The Plan outlines the mandate, vision, and programmes for the organisation, and places the strong emphasis on effective delivery of services to SPREP Member countries and territories. SPREP is based in Apia, Samoa, with over 90 staff recruited from around the Pacific region and abroad.
