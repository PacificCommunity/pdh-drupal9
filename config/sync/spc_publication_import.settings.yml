Along with technical assistance provided during collections, we run specialist training workshops around the Pacific region and Noumea-based attachments where Pacific Region National Statistics Offices staff work alongside SDD staff on specific projects.","image_url":"2019-02-14-224921.405349SDDtr.png","created":"2018-11-01T12:12:26.266879","is_organization":true,"approval_status":"approved","state":"active"},"owner_org":"c9a3d7ed-a5fc-4b74-b4fd-5fc1fd939cd0","private":false,"publisher_name":"Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9","source":["https:\/\/microdata.pacificdata.org\/index.php\/catalog\/160"],"state":"active","thematic_area_string":["Official Statistics"],"title":"Wallis and Futuna Enqu\u00eate Mondiale R\u00e9alis\u00e9e en Milieu Scolaire sur la Sant\u00e9 des El\u00e8ves 2015","type":"dataset","url":"https:\/\/microdata.pacificdata.org\/index.php\/catalog\/160","version":"Version 01: Base de donn\u00e9es edit\u00e9e et anonymis\u00e9e destin\u00e9e a la dissemination publique.","version_notes":"Cette version de la base de donn\u00e9es a ete cr\u00e9ee par l''Ogranisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 et est directement telechargeable sur le site de l''organisation.","extras":[{"key":"harvest_object_id","value":"15395538-3135-4e10-984f-276d80a95a20"},{"key":"harvest_source_id","value":"cb8137f8-5042-4013-8467-65777b60fe79"},{"key":"harvest_source_title","value":"microdata_library"}],"resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"created":"2021-03-25T13:20:02.005235","datastore_active":false,"datastore_contains_all_records_of_source_file":false,"description":"Questionnaire","format":"PDF","hash":"","id":"4f84e94c-430c-4e1e-a853-b9acd8817e63","last_modified":null,"metadata_modified":"2021-03-25T13:20:01.272321","mimetype":"application\/pdf","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Questionnaire -
