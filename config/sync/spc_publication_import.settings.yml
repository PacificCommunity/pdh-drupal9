Associated with this is the adoption of legislation or policies to guarantee freedom of information, and while adoption is low in the Pacific, awareness is increasing; Birth registration is necessary to safeguard individual rights and promote access to justice and social services. The Pacific region has seen improved levels of registration of children under five years due to co-ordinated regional efforts under the Brisbane Accord Group (BAG); Violence in all its forms, and the official reporting of violence to competent authorities, is also a component of Goal 16.
