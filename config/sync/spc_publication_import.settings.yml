Along with technical assistance provided during collections, we run specialist training workshops around the Pacific region and Noumea-based attachments where Pacific Region National Statistics Offices staff work alongside SDD staff on specific projects.","image_url":"2019-02-14-224921.405349SDDtr.png","created":"2018-11-01T12:12:26.266879","is_organization":true,"approval_status":"approved","state":"active"},"owner_org":"c9a3d7ed-a5fc-4b74-b4fd-5fc1fd939cd0","private":false,"publisher_name":"SPC","source":["https:\/\/stats.pacificdata.org\/vis?locale=en&dataflow[datasourceId]=SPC2&dataflow[agencyId]=SPC&dataflow[dataflowId]=DF_UIS&dataflow[version]=1.0"],"state":"active","thematic_area_string":["Official Statistics"],"title":"Thematic (SDG goal 4) indicators on Education","type":"dataset","url":null,"version":"1.0","extras":[{"key":"harvest_object_id","value":"640214da-26ec-4a46-83fa-baff0caada7f"},{"key":"harvest_source_id","value":"74d286e7-f4db-42b9-bcb1-66bbc83a17a1"},{"key":"harvest_source_title","value":"pdhdotstat"}],"resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"cache_url":null,"ckan_url":"https:\/\/pacificdata.org","created":"2021-04-26T14:20:45.780793","datastore_active":true,"datastore_contains_all_records_of_source_file":true,"description":"All data for Thematic (SDG goal 4) indicators on Education","format":"CSV","hash":"ac99aec0809ed18767ea11c6b611a3fe","id":"1363b73d-2897-4665-96d6-7e735a866735","ignore_hash":false,"last_modified":null,"metadata_modified":"2021-04-26T14:42:47.930349","mimetype":"CSV","mimetype_inner":null,"name":"Thematic (SDG goal 4) indicators on Education Data CSV","original_url":"https:\/\/stats-nsi-stable.pacificdata.org\/rest\/data\/SPC,DF_UIS,1.0\/all\/?format=csv","package_id":"SPC-DF_UIS","position":0,"resource_id":"1363b73d-2897-4665-96d6-7e735a866735","resource_type":null,"set_url_type":false,"size":0,"state":"active","task_created":"2021-04-26 14:20:45.899100","url":"https:\/\/stats-nsi-stable.pacificdata.org\/rest\/data\/SPC,DF_UIS,1.0\/all\/?format=csv","url_type":null}],"tags":[{"display_name":"social","id":"7b33748f-5c8f-440d-9d10-7d20ac6397be","name":"social","state":"active","vocabulary_id":null}],"groups":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"relationships_as_object":[],"tracking_summary":{"total":0,"recent":0},"five_star_rating":5,"ga_view_count":0,"short_notes":"Selection of thematic educa...","organization_image_url":"https:\/\/pacificdata.org\/data\/uploads\/group\/2019-02-14-224921.405349SDDtr.png","isPartOf":"pdh.sdd.DotStat"}]'
